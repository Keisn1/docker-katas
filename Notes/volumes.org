#+title: Volumes

Persisting data should be outside of the container
* Ways of mounting data
Mounting is the process of making a file system accessible to the operating system.
It attaches a file system to a specified directory (=the mount point=).

In the context of Docker containers, mounting refers to the process of linking a directory from the host machine or another Docker volume to a directory within the container.

** bind mounts
Bind mounts mount host paths, like =/data=, and mounts them inside the container =/opt/app/data=.

pros:
- easy
- direct connection to host filesystem

cons:
- need to be specified at runtime
  - path to mount might vary from host to host
- need to deal with backup, migration in a tool outside Docker ecosystem

** volumes
- using a =named= or =unnamed= volume to store external data
